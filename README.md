Welcome to the British Airways Review Analysis project! üõ´

## Description

British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). This project focuses on collecting and analyzing customer reviews specifically about British Airways flights. The goal is to uncover insights from these reviews using various data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Collection**
   - The initial step involves scraping review data from the web. The website Skytrax is used for this purpose. The reviews are focused on British Airways flights.
   - Python's Beautiful Soup library is used for web scraping. The code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook in the Resources section.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Once the review dataset is collected, the next step is data analysis. The data is often messy and contains textual information.
   - Data cleaning techniques are applied to prepare the data for analysis.
   - The analysis includes:
     - **Topic Modelling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to identify topics within the reviews, revealing common themes and subjects.
     - **Sentiment Analysis**: The TextBlob library is employed to analyze the sentiment of reviews, providing an overall positive/negative sentiment score.
     - **Wordclouds**: Visual representations of the most frequent words in the reviews are created using the WordCloud library.

3. **Technology Stack**
   - Python is the primary programming language used for this project.
   - Libraries used include Beautiful Soup for web scraping, LDA for topic modelling, TextBlob for sentiment analysis, and WordCloud for word visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can find the list of required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Create a folder named "data" to store the scraped review data.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to perform web scraping and save the reviews to the "data" folder.
4. Use the same notebook to perform data cleaning and analysis using LDA and sentiment analysis techniques.
5. Visualize insights through wordclouds.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Let's work together to uncover valuable insights from British Airways customer reviews and make a real impact on the airline industry! ‚úàÔ∏èüìä

### Note

This project was completed as part of a data analysis challenge, and the provided code and analysis techniques are for educational purposes.
